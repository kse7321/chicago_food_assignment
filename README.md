# chicago_food_assignment
Assignment for Database Systems working with a NoSQL/ElasticSearch Chicago Food Inspection database and using GeoJSON data and geographical data visualization via Folio.
The Jupyter notebook showcases my ability to query in NoSQL and perform data cleansing and transformation tasks via pandas. It also shows my ability to use GeoJSON data and geographical data visualization. There is also a pdf version of my notebook, as the Folio heatmaps would not load properly in GitHub.
